                <p>Welcome! My name is Tessa, and this is my first website. I live in a small, blue house in Iowa with my husband, Luke. I am originally from the city of Chicago where my parents still currently reside. I have two wonderful puppies named Bmo and Milo who love to play outside. Currently, I am a substitute teacher for middle school students, but I am exploring my passions to see where my career takes me next. Here you will find some of my written works and my artwork. Enjoy!  </p>
